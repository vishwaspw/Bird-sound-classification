# BirdCLEF 2025 - Bird Sound Classification

## Project Overview
This project is part of the BirdCLEF 2025 challenge, focused on bird sound classification and identification. The system uses machine learning to identify bird species from audio recordings, contributing to biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts.

## Features
- Real-time bird sound classification
- Web interface for audio file upload and analysis
- Support for both single-species and soundscape recordings
- Interactive visualization of classification results

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the environment variables if needed

## Usage
### Training
